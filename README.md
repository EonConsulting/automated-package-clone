This is a little script I create to automate the cloning of the packages in the "packages" folder. This is  a .bat script that steps through the folders and clones each one from the repository.

Please note:
 - This script is specific to the Unisa E-Content system.
 - This version is for Windows. I will create one for Linux.
 
 Simply copy the .bat file into the "packages" folder, and either double click it, or run it from cmd by typing:
 
    auto_package_clone.bat
